# Test
Pass this test to join the best team in the world
## Stack
* Frontend - React
* Backend - Node.js (mongoose, express)
## What you can use
* React
    * Hooks (best way)
    * Class components
* Styling
    * Pure CSS
    * CSS preprocessors (less, sass)
    * Styled Components
    * Inline-styles (worst way)
* Store
    * Redux (should have best practice arch.)
    * Context
* Node
    * express (you are able to use pure node.js server, but it's not the best way to achieve the goal)
    * mongoose (must use it)
### What you should know to pass the test successfully
* Knowledge in CSS (flexboxes (or grid), positioning, adaptive UI (media queries, etc...))
* Async programming (frontend) - get some data from server
* Async programming (backend) - working with MongoDB (promises, async/await)
* Git (elementary (clone, push))
* Good architecture at all (dividing business logic from view) (benefit)
## Info to begin
### If you haven't installed node.js yet, [install it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
#### To start development you should
* [Install MongoDB if it's not installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
* Clone repo, install all packages and run dev script
```
git clone (repo url)

cd (repo dir)

npm i

npm run dev (or another script)
```
